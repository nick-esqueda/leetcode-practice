        is this a DP problem? yes, want to find the max of something based on decisions.
        subproblems:
            what is the max amount i can rob, up to and including this current house?
            MAIN PROBLEM: what is the max amount you can rob up to and including the last house/index?
        overlapping subproblems: 
            you might want to know the max amount you can rob up to a particular index multiple times
        optimal substructure:
            the max amount you can rob for the whole array relies on the max amount you can rob at each house.
        base cases:
            at house 0, the max you can rob is that number.
            at house 1, the max you can rob is the max of the 0th or 1st amounts;
        RECURRENCE RELATION:
            the max amount that i could rob up to and including this house is either:
                the max you could rob up to 2 houses ago + this house
                - or -
                just the amount you could rob at the previous house (and not including this house).
