        if there is a cycle, what to do?
        if you just keep track of visited, you'd be able to not go back, and since you HAVE to start from k...
        ---
        we're not dealing with nodes that are connected to every single other node, we're just dealing with a DAG.
        since this is the case, we don't have to keep track of visited
        we also can just break out of the loop when the heap becomes empty
        the heap will only ever become empty once you've been to every node (i think?)
