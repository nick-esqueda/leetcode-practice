        PROBLEM:
            minumum cost to reach 1 step out of bounds
            once you pay the cost at i, you can move forward either 1 or 2 steps
            you can start at either the 0th or 1st index
        subproblems:
            the min cost to the top at index 0 relies on the min cost at idx 1 and idx 2, etc...
        overlapping subproblems:
            the min cost for step 3 might be needed for step 1 and 2, etc...
        optimal substructure:
            the optimal solution to 2 different steps are needed to calculate the main solution.
        DP!
        base cases:
            at the last index, the min cost to reach the top is the cost at that index
